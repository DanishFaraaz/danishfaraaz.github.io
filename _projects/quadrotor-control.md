description: >
    Completed for the final project submission of MAE 506 - Advanced System Dynamics and Control for my Fall 2019 term at ASU. Stabilized a quadrotor model with different controllers namely - LQR, closed-loop feedback, observer-based feedback and PID. Non-linear dynamic equations were converted to state-space form and linearized about hover conditions.
