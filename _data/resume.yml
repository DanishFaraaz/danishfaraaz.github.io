  summary: >
    I'm currently pursuing a thesis based Masters in Robotics and Autonmous Systems at Arizona State University. <br><br>
    I tend not to restrict myself to a particular field in robotics and try to get acquanited with anything I can.  
    I am always looking to work on exciting projects and strive to improve myself everyday..<br><br>
    I believe that a perfect roboticist is someone who can work on and solve any given problem, be it on sensor fusion or artificial intelligence or machine vision. 
    If you're interested in something within my skill-set, or would like to discuss something tech. related then, feel free to reach out.<br><br> 
    I'd love to talk.<br><br>
